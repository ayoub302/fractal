Fractol
Fractol is a project that allows you to explore and generate various types of fractals, including the famous Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, Mandelbox, Celtic fractals, Burning Ship fractals, and more. This project is designed to provide a graphical representation of these fascinating mathematical structures, allowing users to interact with them and learn more about their properties.

Features
Mandelbrot Set: Visualize the iconic Mandelbrot set and explore its intricate boundary.
Julia Set: Generate Julia sets by manipulating the constant parameter for each point in the complex plane.
Mandelbox Fractal: A 3D version of the Mandelbrot set, offering a unique and complex geometry.
Celtic Fractals: Explore fractals inspired by Celtic patterns, with intricate symmetry and repetition.
Burning Ship Fractal: A variant of the Mandelbrot set, but with a different formula that creates stunning ship-like structures.
Interactive Controls: Zoom in, zoom out, and move around to explore the fractals at different levels of detail.
Real-Time Rendering: Experience real-time rendering of fractals with optimized algorithms.
